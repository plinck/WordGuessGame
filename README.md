# JavaScript Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, I createe a Word Guess game that is like hangman.  The theme is new wave bands I liked from the 80's.  I created a class "WordGuessGame" that is like the view controller and has all logic for the overall game - wins, all words/images, progress and interacting with html to disoplay.  The wordGuess object has all the guts of guessing a single word.  The main class WordGuessGame uses wordGuess to handle the workload of
making guesses for one word.

The game randomly selects aband from my list and gives the user a number of tries to get it right.  I do not count guesses that are duplicates and I do not count guesses that are correct.  I allow them so many incorrect guess before game is over.

If they get the word right, I show the cover art for that band.  If they run out of guesses without getting it right, I dont change the image so they can see the last one that was right.

I have some sound in it for now, but audio automatically palying on webpages is annoying so I dont plan to do background music.

This app runs in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
